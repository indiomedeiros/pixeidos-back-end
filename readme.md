Instructions
===
`npm install`: Installs the project's dependencies.
The .env file must be created with the information from your database.
```
DB_HOST = host
DB_USER = user
DB_PASSWORD = password
DB_NAME = database-name
BCRYPT_COST = password complexity in numbers (10)
JWT_KEY =  key to JWT
JWT_EXPIRES_IN = token expiration time (1d, 1y)
```
Create tables
---
* `npm run createTables` - Creates the necessary tables for the project.
* `npm run start` - Starts the connection to the database and runs the project. You need to give the command ctrl + C to stop the execution.
* `npm run dev`: Restart the server automatically every time the project is saved.
* `npm run test`: Run unit tests

How to test API endpoints?
